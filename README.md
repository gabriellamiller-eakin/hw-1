## Description 

Beginning with starter code that I modified, this assignment is focused around accessibility. Accessible websites ensure that people with disabilites can access the website using assistive technologies. It also helps a website be better positioned in search engines like Google. 

With specific criteria written in user story format with acceptance criteria. 

## User Story: 

As a marketing agency, I want a codebase that follows accessbility standards, so that our own website is optimized for search engines. 

## Acceptance Criteria: 

GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

## Changes 
Changed unecessary <divs> to follow HTML semantics
Added "alt" text to all images
Added comments to CSS to explain what the code is doing 
Re-organized CSS to be in order and grouped by common elements 
Fixed any image tags that had closing </img> when not necessary 
Added a title to the website tab "Horiseon Website!"
